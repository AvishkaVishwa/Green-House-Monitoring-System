# Green-House-Monitoring-System

This project is an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system implemented using ESP8266, Blynk, and various sensors. It monitors soil moisture, CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and ambient light levels in a greenhouse environment. The system controls a water pump and a relay for turning on/off a bulb based on the sensor readings.

### Features
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and light levels.
- Automatic control of water pump based on soil moisture level.
- Automatic control of a bulb based on light levels.
- Remote monitoring and control via the Blynk mobile app.

### Components Used
- ESP8266 microcontroller
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Soil moisture sensor
- MQ135 CO2 sensor
- Light-dependent resistor (LDR)
- OLED display for local display
- Relay module for controlling the bulb
- Water pump
