# Green-House-Monitoring-System ðŸ¥¦

This project is an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system implemented using ESP8266, Blynk, and various sensors. It monitors soil moisture, CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and light levels in a greenhouse environment. The system controls a water pump and a relay for turning on/off a bulb based on the sensor readings.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and light levels.
- Automatic control of the water pump based on soil moisture levels.
- Automatic control of a bulb based on light levels.
- Remote monitoring and control via the Blynk mobile app.

## Components Used

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Soil moisture sensor
- MQ135 CO2 sensor
- Light-dependent resistor (LDR)
- OLED display for local data display
- Relay module for controlling the bulb
- Water pump

## System Overview

The system collects data from various sensors and sends it to the Blynk mobile app for real-time monitoring. Based on the sensor values:
- The water pump is activated when the soil moisture level is below a predefined threshold.
- A bulb is turned on/off based on the light levels detected by the LDR.

The system also displays the readings on an OLED display for local monitoring within the greenhouse.

## Installation and Setup

1. Connect the components as per the schematic.
2. Upload the code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure the Blynk app with the projectâ€™s Blynk authentication token.
4. Ensure the ESP8266 is connected to a stable Wi-Fi network.
5. Monitor and control the system using the Blynk app.

## How It Works

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture content. If the value drops below a set threshold, the water pump is activated.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: The DHT11 sensor measures the greenhouse environmentâ€™s temperature and humidity and displays it on the OLED screen and Blynk app.
- **CO2 Monitoring**: The MQ135 sensor measures CO2 levels to monitor air quality.
- **Light Level Monitoring**: The LDR measures light levels, and a relay controls a bulb to maintain optimal lighting conditions.

## Future Enhancements

- Addition of a fan system for temperature control.
- Integration of a pH sensor for soil quality monitoring.
- Expansion to support multiple greenhouses.
